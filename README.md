# Train Scheduler

## What this does:
This app allows users to enter train information and see when the next train will appear.

## How the code works:
The train schedule application incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

## How to run the app/deployed version:
